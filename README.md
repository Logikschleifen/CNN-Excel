## CNN in Excel
Before you ask. No it does not let you train a model. This is simply a pretrained model using Pytorch that was put in a nice accessible package for anyone to use (Excel). 

I just wanted to learn some math with a little cnn project. So I did. To use this you have to copy and paste values into the interface tab of the Excel sheet.
If you don't want to enter values one at a time then use the tkinter app to select a 28 x 28 pixel image. It will copy it to your clipboard so you can use in the spreadsheet.

I precompiled the tkinter app for windows users. Hope it works. Am I missing anything? Oh yea, small folder of test images from MNIST data set. If you hand draw images it will be less accurate.
If you are using the copy paster then make your image white on black. See the samples.

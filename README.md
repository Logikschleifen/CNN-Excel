## CNN in Excel
Before you ask. No it does not let you train a model. This is simply a pretrained model using Pytorch that was put in a nice accessible package for anyone to use (Excel). 

I just wanted to learn some math with a little cnn project. So I did. To use this you have to copy and paste values into the interface tab of the Excel sheet.
